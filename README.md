Project Overview
The Inverter Design Project aims to analyze and compare the THD of different inverter types. THD is a measure of the distortion introduced by an inverter's output waveform. By performing FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) analysis, we can evaluate the harmonic content in the voltage and current outputs of each inverter design. The project involves implementing various inverter topologies, simulating or prototyping them, and conducting THD analysis to assess their performance.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

Inverter Types: Develop and compare the THD of the following inverter types:

Square Wave Inverter
Quasi Square Wave Inverter
Optimized PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Inverter
Multilevel Inverter
Bipolar Inverter
Unipolar Inverter
FFT Analysis: Perform FFT analysis on the voltage and current outputs of each inverter type to determine their harmonic content and calculate the THD.

Comparison: Compare the THD values obtained from different inverter designs and evaluate their performance in terms of waveform quality and distortion.

Optimization: Explore techniques to optimize the inverter designs for reduced THD and improved waveform quality.
