# Inverter Design Project

Welcome to the Inverter Design Project! This project is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on comparing various single-phase inverters, including square wave, quasi square wave, optimized PWM, multilevel, bipolar, and unipolar inverters. The second part compares different PWM techniques, such as sinusoidal PWM, trapezoidal PWM, and square PWM, on three-phase inverters. In both parts, the voltage and current outputs, as well as the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), will be analyzed. This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for setting up and running the inverter design.

## Project Overview

The Inverter Design Project is divided into two parts. The first part compares single-phase inverters, including square wave, quasi square wave, optimized PWM, multilevel, bipolar, and unipolar inverters. The second part focuses on comparing different PWM techniques, such as sinusoidal PWM, trapezoidal PWM, and square PWM, on three-phase inverters. In both parts, the voltage and current outputs, along with the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), will be analyzed using FFT analysis. The project involves implementing the inverter topologies, simulating or prototyping them, and conducting THD analysis to evaluate their performance.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

Part 1: Single-phase Inverters
1. Develop and compare the THD of different single-phase inverters:
   - Square Wave Inverter
   - Quasi Square Wave Inverter
   - Optimized PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Inverter
   - Multilevel Inverter
   - Bipolar Inverter
   - Unipolar Inverter

2. Perform FFT analysis on the voltage and current outputs of each single-phase inverter to determine their harmonic content and calculate the THD.

3. Compare the THD values obtained from different single-phase inverter designs and evaluate their waveform quality and distortion.

Part 2: Three-phase Inverters with PWM Techniques
1. Compare different PWM techniques, including sinusoidal PWM, trapezoidal PWM, and square PWM, on three-phase inverters.

2. Analyze the voltage and current outputs of three-phase inverters using different PWM techniques.

3. Perform FFT analysis on the voltage and current outputs to calculate the THD and compare the harmonic content.

4. Evaluate the performance of different PWM techniques in terms of waveform quality and distortion.
